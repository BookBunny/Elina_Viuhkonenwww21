 <h2>Illuminae</h2>
 <h3>by Amie Kaufman and Jay Kristoff</h3>
 <img src="images/Illuminae_cover.jpg" alt="Illuminae book cover" align="right">
  <p>This morning, Kady thought breaking up with Ezra was the hardest thing she’d have to do. This afternoon, her planet was invaded.</p>
 <p>The year is 2575, and two rival mega-corporations are at war over a planet that’s little more than a speck at the edge of the
     universe. Now with enemy fire raining down on them, Kady and Ezra — who are barely even talking to each other—are forced to
     evacuate with a hostile warship in hot pursuit. </p>
    <p>But their problems are just getting started. A plague has broken out and is mutating with terrifying results; the fleet’s AI
        may actually be their enemy; and nobody in charge will say what’s really going on. As Kady hacks into a web of data to find
        the truth, it’s clear the only person who can help her is the ex-boyfriend she swore she’d never speak to again.</p>
    <p>Told through a fascinating dossier of hacked documents — including emails, maps, files, IMs, medical reports, interviews, an
        more — Illuminae is the first book in a heart-stopping trilogy about lives interrupted, the price of truth, and the courage
        of everyday heroes.</p>
